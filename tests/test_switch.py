"""Tests for Wave 3.0 slot-model switch behavior.

Coverage:
  - fast-path swap when Y is warm in some slot (no worktree add)
  - cold-Y allocates the lowest free slot for X
  - cap-reached + ``no_evict=True`` raises ``BlockerError(worktree_cap_reached)``

Slot-model fixtures (workspace_with_canonical_only / workspace_with_slots /
workspace_with_full_slots) live in conftest.py.
