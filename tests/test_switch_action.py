"""Tests for canopy.actions.switch — Wave 2.9 canonical-slot model.

Replaces the older 3-case context-activator behavior. New surface:
``switch(Y, release_current=False, no_evict=False, evict=None)``.

Coverage:
  - active rotation (default): X canonical → X warm worktree, Y warm → Y canonical
  - wind-down mode: X goes cold (with feature-tagged stash if dirty)
  - cap-reached blocker (active rotation past warm slot cap)
  - LRU eviction with auto-stash when cap fires + auto-pick
  - explicit ``evict=<feature>`` overrides LRU pick
  - no-op when main is already on the target branch
  - missing branch: created from default
  - lazy 2.9 migration on first switch
  - reverse evacuation: Y was warm, must be removed before main can adopt it
