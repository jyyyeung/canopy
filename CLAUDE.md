# Canopy — Claude Code Context

## What This Project Is

Canopy is the **context contract** between an AI coding agent and a multi-repo workspace, plus a **drift-proof CLI** for the human. Every operation takes semantic context (`feature`, `repo`, alias) and resolves paths internally — the agent literally can't `cd` to the wrong directory because it never specifies a directory. Multi-repo drift is detected in real time via per-repo post-checkout hooks and surfaced as a structured `BlockerError`. PR review comments are temporally classified into `actionable_threads` vs `likely_resolved_threads`, so the agent's context budget goes to comprehension, not orchestration.

**`canopy switch` is the focus primitive (Wave 3.0 slot model).** Each feature lives in one of three states: **canonical** (checked out in main repo — the only place code is meant to run), **warm** (occupies a numbered slot at `.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/<repo>/`), **cold** (branch only). Slots are stable disk resources; features are transient tenants — a slot keeps its id (`worktree-1`, `worktree-2`, ...) across feature swaps. `switch(Y)` promotes Y to canonical; previously-canonical X either evacuates into a warm slot (active rotation, default — instant to switch back) or goes cold with a feature-tagged stash (wind-down via `--release-current`). Cap (`slots`, default 2) protects against unbounded growth via LRU eviction or a `worktree_cap_reached` BlockerError. See [docs/concepts.md §4](docs/concepts.md#4-the-slot-model).

```

## Key conventions

- **`git/repo.py` is the only module that calls `subprocess.run(["git", ...])`.** Everything else routes through it. Keeps the git layer testable and replaceable.
- **`mcp/server.py` and `cli/main.py` are thin wrappers.** Business logic lives in `actions/`, `features/coordinator.py`, `git/multi.py`, `workspace/`.
- **All CLI commands support `--json`.** This is the contract between CLI, MCP, and any GUI. Same JSON shape across surfaces.
- **Actions return structured errors.** `BlockerError(code, what, expected, actual, fix_actions, details)`. CLI renders via `cli/render.py`; MCP returns `to_dict()`. Same shape, two consumers.
- **Universal aliases** — every read tool accepts feature name, Linear ID, `<repo>#<n>`, PR URL, `<repo>:<branch>`, or slot id (`worktree-N` → slot's current occupant). Resolved by `actions/aliases.py:resolve_feature` (with single-repo + per-repo-branch fallbacks).
- **Per-repo branches map** — `FeatureLane.branches: dict[repo, branch]` overrides "branch == feature name" for legacy mismatched-naming features. Use `lane.branch_for(repo)` or `repos_for_feature(workspace, feature)` everywhere — never recompute as `[r for r in feature.repos]` with feature name as branch (regresses Gap 2).
- **Feature lanes use real Git branches and worktrees.** No virtual branches.
- **Feature metadata lives in `.canopy/features.json`. Worktrees in `.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/<repo>/` (generic numbered slots).** A slot holds one feature at a time; a feature's repos sit as siblings inside its slot. Canonical (main repo dirs) is the only place to *run* code; worktrees are passive branch storage.
- **State files** at `.canopy/state/heads.json` (post-checkout hook output), `.canopy/state/preflight.json` (preflight tracker), and `.canopy/state/slots.json` (canonical + warm slot occupancy + `last_touched` LRU map + `in_flight` transaction marker). OAuth tokens at `~/.canopy/mcp-tokens/`.
- **MCP client supports two transports.** Stdio (existing) for npm/python servers. HTTP+OAuth (new) for hosted servers like Linear's `mcp.linear.app`. Tokens cache per server.
- **GitHub fallback to gh CLI.** When no `github` MCP server is configured, `integrations/github.py` falls back to `gh api` / `gh pr` for the same return shapes. If neither is available, raises `BlockerError(code='github_not_configured')` with platform-aware install hints.
- **Single source of truth for state.** `feature_state` uses live git (not heads.json) so it's correct even when the hook hasn't fired. `drift` uses heads.json for the fast cached path.
- **Feature-aware stash tagging** — `stash save --feature` writes `[canopy <feature> @ <ts>] <message>`. Parser tolerates git's `On <branch>: ` auto-prefix.

## Build & Test

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -v          # 401 tests, ~60s
```

## Test Fixtures

Tests use real temporary Git repos created in `tests/conftest.py`:
- `workspace_dir` — bare workspace with `api/` and `ui/` repos on main
- `workspace_with_feature` — workspace with `auth-flow` branches + commits in both repos
- `canopy_toml` — workspace with a canopy.toml already written

For integration testing against real services, see `~/projects/canopy-test/` (memory: project_test_workspace).

## Important Implementation Details

- **Python 3.10+ compat:** `tomli` on 3.10, `tomllib` on 3.11+. See `config.py`.
- **Drift detection:** post-checkout hook installed by `canopy init` (or `canopy hooks install`). Hook is Python; uses `fcntl.flock` + atomic rename so concurrent fires across repos don't race. Respects `core.hooksPath` (Husky-friendly). Chains pre-existing user hooks. Worktrees inherit hooks via `commondir` resolution.
- **`--no-track` on branch creation:** `git/repo.py:create_branch` and `worktree_add` always pass `--no-track` so a `branch.autoSetupMerge=inherit` gitconfig doesn't accidentally set the new branch's upstream to `dev`.
- **Slot limits:** `[workspace] slots = N` in canopy.toml caps the number of warm slots (default **2**, so 1 canonical + 2 warm = 3 live trees max). The pre-3.0 `max_worktrees` key now raises `ConfigError` pointing at `canopy migrate-slots`. See `actions/switch_preflight.py:warm_slot_cap`.
- **Action contract:** `actions/protocol.py` (planned) will formalize the per-repo `{status, before, after, reason?}` shape. For now, each action returns it ad-hoc.
- **Skill bundling:** Bundled skills live at `src/canopy/agent_setup/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. `canopy setup-agent` copies them to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The default `using-canopy` skill always installs; opt-in extras (e.g. `augment-canopy`) install via `--skill <name>` (repeatable). Foreign skills with the same path are not overwritten without `--reinstall`. The `_SKILL_SOURCE` constant remains as a backward-compat alias pointing at `using-canopy`'s source.
- **Version bumps:** When shipping a milestone, bump `__version__` in [`src/canopy/__init__.py`](src/canopy/__init__.py) and add a section to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The version handshake (`canopy --version`, `mcp__canopy__version`, doctor's `cli_stale` / `mcp_stale` checks) is only useful when this number actually moves — drift was the bug 0.5.0 caught.

## MCP Server (64 tools)

Grouped by topic. Run with `canopy-mcp` (entry point) or `python -m canopy.mcp.server`.

## MCP Client

Two transports.

**stdio** for npm/python servers:
```json
{ "github": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
              "env": {"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_..."} } }
```

**HTTP + OAuth** for hosted servers like Linear:
```json
{ "linear": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp", "oauth": true } }
```

Token cache at `~/.canopy/mcp-tokens/<server>.{client,tokens}.json`. First call opens browser; subsequent calls silent.

## When working in this repo

- Read `docs/concepts.md` if you need the action framework / state machine vocabulary.
- Read `docs/agents.md` if you're implementing or using the agent integration.
- New actions: stub in `src/canopy/actions/`, raise `BlockerError` for preconditions, expose via CLI in `cli/main.py` + MCP in `mcp/server.py`. Add tests in `tests/test_<action>.py` using the existing `workspace_with_feature` fixture.
- New MCP tools: register an existing `actions/*.py` function under `@mcp.tool()` in `mcp/server.py`. Update `docs/mcp.md` and `docs/agents.md`.
- New CLI commands: define a handler `cmd_<name>(args)`, add a subparser in `main()`, dispatch in the `commands` dict. Update `docs/commands.md`.
- Adding a new ⨯ tool to canopy → also update `~/.claude/skills/using-canopy/SKILL.md` and `src/canopy/agent_setup/skills/using-canopy/SKILL.md` so the agent learns when to prefer it.
