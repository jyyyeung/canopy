# Commands

Every command supports `--json`. Commands that accept a feature name accept any [universal alias](concepts.md#universal-aliases) (feature name, Linear ID, `<repo>#<n>`, PR URL, `<repo>:<branch>`).

Organized by **workflow stage** — top to bottom matches a typical day.

## Setup

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy init [path]` | Discover repos, write `canopy.toml`, install drift hooks, register the `using-canopy` skill, add canopy MCP to `.mcp.json`. Use `--no-agent` to skip the skill + MCP bits. |
| `canopy setup-agent` | Install (or refresh) the agent integration only — skill + MCP. `--check` reports status. `--reinstall` forces overwrite. `--skill-only` / `--mcp-only` for partial installs. |
| `canopy hooks install\|uninstall\|status` | Manage the post-checkout hooks per repo. Hooks are what feed `.canopy/state/heads.json`. |
| `canopy config [key] [value]` | Read/write workspace settings (e.g. `slots`). |
| `canopy migrate-slots` | **Wave 3.0.** One-shot migration from pre-3.0 feature-named worktrees (`.canopy/worktrees/<feature>/<repo>/`) to the slot model (`.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/<repo>/`). Renames dirs, rewrites canopy.toml (`max_worktrees` → `slots`), migrates `active_feature.json` → `slots.json`. Dry-run preflight; refuses on dirty trees. Idempotent — refuses to re-run when `slots.json` already exists. |

## Discover

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy triage [--author @me]` | Prioritized list of features needing attention. Groups open PRs across repos by feature, sorts by review state (`changes_requested` > `review_required_with_bot_comments` > `review_required` > `approved`). Use this every morning. |
| `canopy state <feature>` | The 9-state machine for one feature, plus the suggested `next_actions`. Same JSON the dashboard renders. |
| `canopy drift [<feature>]` | Per-feature alignment from `.canopy/state/heads.json` (the post-checkout hook's data). Fast, hook-driven. Doesn't touch git directly. |
| `canopy list` | Compact feature overview — names, Linear links, per-repo branch/dirty/ahead-behind. |
| `canopy status` | Per-repo branch + dirty + divergence from default branch. |
| `canopy feature list` | Same as `list` (legacy spelling). |
| `canopy feature status <name>` | Detailed per-repo state + merge-readiness check. |
| `canopy worktree` | Live worktree dashboard — branch, dirty state, ahead/behind per linked worktree. |
| `canopy slots [--rich]` | **Wave 3.0.** Slot occupancy snapshot — what's in canonical and each warm slot, plus the `last_touched` LRU. `--rich` (implied by `--json`) enriches each slot with branch, dirty, ahead/behind, PR + CI rollup, unresolved bot threads, linear link, and the computed `feature_state` per repo — the same payload the dashboard renders. |
| `canopy log [--feature <f>]` | Interleaved chronological log across repos. |

## Read

Read primitives — alias-aware fetches against Linear and GitHub. Use these instead of shelling `gh api` or `gh pr view`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy issue <alias>` | Linear issue by ID (`SIN-412`) or feature alias (lookup via lane's `linear_issue`). |
| `canopy pr <alias>` | PR data per repo. Alias forms: feature, `<repo>#<n>`, PR URL. |
| `canopy branch info <alias>` | Branch HEAD, upstream, ahead/behind per repo. Alias forms: feature, `<repo>:<branch>`. |
| `canopy comments <alias>` | Temporally classified PR review comments — `actionable_threads` vs `likely_resolved_threads` vs resolved count. Alias: feature, `<repo>#<n>`, PR URL. |
| `canopy review <feature>` | Combined: PR status + unresolved comments + pre-commit checks. Older composite — prefer `state` + `comments` separately. |
| `canopy feature diff <name>` | Aggregate diff vs default branch + cross-repo type overlap detection. |
| `canopy feature changes <name>` | Per-file change summary across the feature lane. |

## Work

Write actions and execution.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy start <alias>` | **Registry consolidation (4.0 phase 3).** Begin new work: resolves the issue provider best-effort (Linear ID, GitHub issue, etc.) and creates the feature lazily — zero repos until you `join`. Marks the feature active in `.canopy/state/active.json`. |
| `canopy join <repo>` | **Registry consolidation (4.0 phase 3).** The lazy-growth primitive: creates the active feature's branch in `<repo>`, registers the repo on the feature lane, and promotes the feature to canonical so the enforcement gate and `context` recognize it. A raw `git checkout -b` does not register — `context` will advise `join` for unregistered branches. |
| `canopy resume <alias> [--reset-anchor]` | **Session-start primitive (Plan 2).** Switch-aware compound action: alias → switch-if-needed → refresh GitHub + Linear → compute structured brief → bump last-visit anchor. Returns `{feature, switch_performed, first_visit, window_hours, since_last_visit, current_state, next_actions, intent_hints}`. Use this instead of manually calling `switch` + `feature_state` + `github_get_pr_comments` at the start of a session. `--reset-anchor` sets the anchor to now (useful when you want a fresh delta window). See [concepts.md §5](concepts.md#5-returning-to-a-feature--the-resume-brief). |
| `canopy resolve <thread_id> [--feature <f>]` | **Plan 2.** Resolve a GitHub PR review thread via GraphQL + record the closure in `.canopy/state/thread_resolutions.json`. The log feeds `feature_resume`'s `since_last_visit.resolved_threads` count. `--feature` pins which feature the resolution is attributed to (defaults to the canonical feature). |
| `canopy reply <thread_id> [--body <text> \| --body-file <path> \| stdin] [--resolve] [--feature <f>]` | **Plan 2.** Post a reply to a GitHub review thread. Body comes from `--body`, `--body-file`, or stdin (pipe-friendly). `--resolve` closes the thread after posting (equivalent to `reply_to_thread(..., resolve_after=True)`) and logs the closure. |
| `canopy switch <feature> [--release-current] [--no-evict] [--evict <f>] [--evict-to <slot-N>] [--to-slot <slot-N>]` | **The focus primitive (Wave 3.0 slot model).** Promote a feature to the canonical slot. Default (active rotation): previously-canonical evacuates into a warm slot (full stash → checkout → pop). When the destination is already warm, the swap is a fast 5-op-per-repo dance — no `mv`, no slot renaming. `--release-current` (wind-down): previous goes cold with a feature-tagged stash. `--evict-to <slot-N>` pins which slot the outgoing canonical lands in. `--to-slot <slot-N>` promotes whatever feature already occupies that slot (omit `<feature>`). Cap-reached blocker surfaces explicit fix actions (wind-down, evict a specific slot, raise cap). See [docs/concepts.md §4](concepts.md#4-the-slot-model). |
| `canopy slot load <feature> [<slot-N>] [--replace] [--bootstrap]` | **Wave 3.0.** Warm a cold feature into a slot WITHOUT changing canonical. `<slot-N>` defaults to the lowest free slot. `--replace` evicts the slot's current occupant to cold first. `--bootstrap` runs the env-file copy + install_cmd + IDE workspace gen (same as `canopy worktree-bootstrap`). The feature must already be registered — create it with `canopy feature create` first. |
| `canopy slot clear <slot-N>` | **Wave 3.0.** Evict that slot's occupant to cold with a feature-tagged stash if dirty. The slot id stays — only the occupant moves. |
| `canopy slot swap <slot-A> <slot-B>` | **Wave 3.0.** Exchange the features in two warm slots. v1 requires identical repo scope on both features (mismatched-scope swap raises `BlockerError(code='swap_scope_mismatch')`). |
| `canopy checkout <branch>` | Plain checkout across all repos — no feature context, no per-repo branch resolution. Use `switch` for feature-scoped focus changes. |
| `canopy run <repo> <command> [--feature]` | Run a shell command in a canopy-managed repo with cwd resolved internally. The "agent never `cd`s" tool — also useful from a CLI in a deeply nested directory. |
| `canopy code\|cursor\|fork <feature\|.>` | Open the feature in VS Code / Cursor / Fork.app (alias-aware; generates `.code-workspace` for the IDE ones). |
| `canopy sync` | Pull default branch + rebase feature branches across repos. |
| `canopy commit -m <msg> [--feature <f>] [--repo <r,...>] [--paths <p ...>] [--no-hooks] [--amend] [--address <id>] [--resolve-thread \| --no-resolve-thread]` | **Wave 2.3 + M3 + Plan 2.** Commit across every repo in the canonical (or named) feature with a single message. Pre-flight refuses with `BlockerError(code='wrong_branch')` if any in-scope repo has drifted; per-repo hook failures don't cancel the others (status: `hooks_failed`). `--address <comment-id>` (numeric id or GitHub URL) auto-suffixes the message with the bot comment's title + URL and records the resolution in `.canopy/state/bot_resolutions.json`. Non-bot comments raise `BlockerError(code='not_a_bot_comment')`. `--resolve-thread` additionally closes the corresponding GitHub review thread and logs it to `thread_resolutions.json`. `--no-resolve-thread` disables this even when `[augments] auto_resolve_threads_on_address = true` is set in canopy.toml. |
| `canopy bot-status [--feature <f>] [--unresolved-only]` | **M3.** Per-feature rollup of bot review comments — total / resolved / unresolved per repo + an `all_resolved` flag. Bot vs human classification respects `[augments] review_bots` in canopy.toml. |
| `canopy historian show [<feature>]` | **M4.** Print the rendered memory file for a feature (3 sections: resolutions log, PR context, sessions). Returns empty when no memory has been recorded yet. |
| `canopy historian compact [<feature>] [--keep-sessions <n>]` | **M4.** Trim the Sessions section to the most-recent N (default 5). Resolutions log + PR context are preserved regardless. v1 is mechanical (no LLM); future iterations will summarize. |
| `canopy push [--feature <f>] [--repo <r,...>] [--set-upstream] [--force-with-lease] [--dry-run]` | **Wave 2.3.** Push the feature branch in every in-scope repo. Pre-flight raises `BlockerError(code='no_upstream')` if any repo lacks an upstream and `--set-upstream` was not passed; the fix-action carries the same args + `--set-upstream` so an agent retries mechanically. Per-repo statuses: `ok`, `up_to_date`, `rejected`, `failed`. |

## Verify

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy preflight [<feature>]` | Run per-repo pre-commit checks. With `<feature>`, runs against the feature lane and records the result to `.canopy/state/preflight.json` (which feeds `canopy state`'s `ready_to_commit` detection). Without `<feature>`, runs against the current cwd's context. **Use as a dry-run before `canopy commit`** — preflight stages and runs hooks but never commits. |

## Stash (feature-aware)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy stash save -m <msg> [--feature <f>]` | Stash dirty changes (incl. untracked when `--feature` is used). Tagged stash messages: `[canopy <feature> @ <ts>] <msg>`. |
| `canopy stash list [--feature <f>]` | Stashes across repos. With `--feature`, groups by feature tag. Without, flat list per repo. |
| `canopy stash pop [--feature <f>] [<index>]` | Pop. With `--feature`, pops the most recent matching tagged stash per repo. |
| `canopy stash drop [<index>]` | Drop a stash by index. |

## Worktree

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy worktree <name> [issue]` | Create linked worktrees for a feature in every repo, optionally linking a Linear issue. Worktrees go to `.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/<repo>/` (generic numbered slot, allocated as the lowest free slot). The allocated slot id is returned in the response. |
| `canopy worktree` | Live dashboard (read-only, see "Discover"). |

## Branch

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy branch list` | Branches per repo. |
| `canopy branch delete <name> [--force]` | Delete across repos. |
| `canopy branch rename <old> <new>` | Rename across repos. |
| `canopy branch info <alias>` | Branch state per repo (alias-aware; see "Read"). |

## Cleanup

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy done <feature> [--force]` | Clean up a completed feature — remove worktrees, delete branches (if merged), archive lane in `features.json`. `--force` overrides the dirty-tree refusal. |

## Recover

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy doctor [-v] [--feature <f>]` | Diagnose 21 codes across 12 categories of state-file drift + install staleness (incl. slot-state checks added in Wave 3.0). Reports `errors`/`warnings`/`info` with structured `code`, `expected`, `actual`, and per-issue `fix_action`. **Run this first** when any other canopy operation returns an unexpected error — most "something is off" cases trace to one of these categories. `--json` returns the full report shape `{issues, summary, fixed, skipped}`. |
| `canopy doctor --fix` | Repair every `auto_fixable=true` issue. Examples: rewrite `heads.json` from live git, drop orphan worktree dirs via `git worktree remove --force`, reinstall a missing post-checkout hook, clean up an orphan slot dir, write a missing `.mcp.json` entry, reinstall the `using-canopy` skill. |
| `canopy doctor --fix-category <c>` | Repair just one category (`heads`, `slots`, `active_feature`, `worktrees`, `hooks`, `preflight`, `features`, `branches`, `cli`, `mcp`, `skill`, `vsix`). Implies `--fix`. |
| `canopy doctor --clean-vsix` | Required gate for the destructive `vsix_duplicates` repair (removes all but the newest `singularityinc.canopy-*` install dir). Other repairs are unaffected. |
| `canopy --version` | Print the installed CLI version. |

### Diagnostic codes

State-integrity (the workspace's own bookkeeping):

| Code | Severity | Detection | Auto-fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `heads_stale` | warn | `heads.json` out of sync with `git rev-parse HEAD` | rewrite from live git |
| `active_feature_orphan` | error | `active_feature.json` points at unknown feature | clear the file |
| `active_feature_path_missing` | error | `per_repo_paths` reference non-existent dirs | re-resolve from `features.json` |
| `worktree_orphan` | warn | `.canopy/worktrees/<f>/<r>/` not referenced by any feature | `git worktree remove --force` |
| `worktree_missing` | error | feature × repo `worktree_paths` entry has no dir on disk | drop the entry |
| `slot_dir_orphan` | warn | `.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/` exists with no entry in `slots.json` | drop the dir (Wave 3.0) |
| `slot_entry_orphan` | warn | `slots.json` references a slot whose dir is missing | drop the entry (Wave 3.0) |
| `slot_branch_mismatch` | error | slot's repo HEAD ≠ recorded feature branch | manual (decide which is canonical: live HEAD or slots.json) |
| `slot_detached_head` | info | slot's repo is on a detached HEAD (bisect / explicit checkout `<sha>`) | manual (informational; common during bisect — re-attach when done) |
| `hook_missing` | error | repo lacks canopy's post-checkout hook | reinstall (chains existing user hook) |
| `hook_chained_unsafe` | warn | chained user hook present but not executable | `chmod +x` |
| `preflight_stale` | info | recorded `head_sha_per_repo` no longer matches live HEAD | drop the entry |
| `features_unknown_repo` | error | `features.json` references repo not in `canopy.toml` | manual (decide whether to restore the repo or `done` the feature) |
| `branches_missing` | error | feature's recorded branch doesn't exist locally | manual (restore branch or `done` feature) |

Install-staleness (canopy's installation around the workspace):

| Code | Severity | Detection | Auto-fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cli_stale` | warn | `canopy --version` < running `__version__` | manual reinstall |
| `mcp_stale` | error | `canopy-mcp --version` < running `__version__` | manual reinstall |
| `mcp_missing_in_workspace` | error | `.mcp.json` lacks canopy entry, or its `CANOPY_ROOT` is wrong | `install_mcp(reinstall=True)` |
| `skill_missing` | warn | no `~/.claude/skills/using-canopy/SKILL.md` | `install_skill()` |
| `skill_stale` | warn | installed skill drifted from bundled source | `install_skill(reinstall=True)` |
| `vsix_duplicates` | info | multiple `singularityinc.canopy-*` extension dirs | requires `--clean-vsix` |

## Hooks (enforcement)

Claude Code hooks that stop the agent from mutating git state in the wrong place. Separate from the drift-tracking `canopy hooks install|uninstall|status` (post-checkout, feeds `heads.json`) described in "Setup" above.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy setup-agent --hooks` | Installs (or refreshes) the enforcement hooks into `<workspace>/.claude/settings.json`: a `PreToolUse` entry (matcher `Bash`) running `canopy-hook-gate`, and a `SessionStart` entry running `canopy-hook-context`. **Project-scoped, not user-scoped** — the workspace root is normally not itself a git repo (it's a container of repos), so nothing lands in `~/.claude/settings.json` or in any employer repo's tree. Merges into existing `settings.json`: other keys (`permissions`, foreign hooks) are preserved untouched; re-running is a no-op (`action: "unchanged"`) once both entries are present. If `settings.json` exists but isn't valid JSON, install is skipped with a `reason` rather than clobbering it. Combine with the other `setup-agent` flags (`--skill-only`, `--mcp-only`, `--reinstall`, `--check`) as usual. |

`canopy-hook-gate` and `canopy-hook-context` are internal console scripts (registered in `pyproject.toml`, not meant to be run by hand) that Claude Code invokes per the `settings.json` entries above:

- **`canopy-hook-gate`** (PreToolUse, matcher `Bash`) — reads the tool-call payload as JSON on stdin (`{tool_name, tool_input: {command}, cwd, ...}`). For non-`Bash` calls or commands with no `git` token, exits 0 immediately without touching disk. Otherwise it resolves the workspace from `cwd` (walking up for `canopy.toml`), splits the command on top-level shell operators, tracks the effective directory through `cd` chains and `git -C`, and judges only the mutating git subcommands (`commit`, `push`, `merge`, `rebase`, `reset`, `cherry-pick`, `add`, `rm`, `mv`, `am`, `revert`, mutating `stash` verbs). **Exit 0** = allow (nothing printed). **Exit 2** = block, with a one-line reason on stderr that Claude Code feeds back to the model.
- **`canopy-hook-context`** (SessionStart) — reads the same payload shape, resolves the workspace from `cwd`, and prints a compact brief to stdout (which becomes session context): workspace name, canonical feature, each repo's branch + dirty count, each warm slot's occupant, and a one-line reminder to `canopy switch` before working if the ticket doesn't match. Always exits 0; on any error it prints nothing.

Deny codes (all four block with an explanatory message that also names the fix):

| Code | Meaning | Fix the message names |
|---|---|---|
| `outside_repo` | The mutation's effective directory (after resolving `cd`/`git -C`) isn't inside any workspace repo or slot worktree. | `cd <repo> && git ...`, or use `canopy run`. |
| `trunk_branch_drift` | On **commit/push only**: a canonical-slot repo is on a branch owned by a different registered feature than the current canonical one. (Other mutations like `git add` on a drifted branch are allowed.) | `canopy switch <feature>` (either the branch's owner, or back to canonical). |
| `slot_branch_drift` | On **commit/push only**: a warm-slot repo is on a branch that doesn't match the slot's recorded occupant feature. | `git checkout <expected-branch>` in that worktree, or `canopy doctor`. |
| `push_unknown_branch` | `git push`'s source refspec names a branch that doesn't exist in the effective repo (but does exist in a different one). | Check the branch for *this* repo with `git branch --list` or `canopy context`; likely the wrong repo. |

**Fail-open contract.** The gate only blocks when it's sure the mutation targets the wrong place. It allows (exit 0) on: unparseable shell segments (`shlex` failure), unresolvable `cd` targets (`$VAR`, `~`, backticks, `cd -`), a `cwd` with no `canopy.toml` anywhere above it, non-`Bash` tool calls, commands with no `git` token, and any internal exception — `run_gate` never raises. `checkout`/`switch` are deliberately never gated: they're the recovery action for a drifted branch, and blocking them would trap the agent.

**Escape hatch:** set `CANOPY_HOOKS_DISABLED=1` in the environment to make the gate a no-op (checked first, before any parsing).

**Known bypasses** (deliberate fail-open — not bugs, documented so nobody relies on the gate as a security boundary):
- Env-prefix invocations: `GIT_TRACE=1 git push`, `env git push` — the leading token isn't `git`, so the segment isn't recognized as a git mutation.
- Non-literal git: `/usr/bin/git ...`, `command git ...`, `sh -c "git push"`, `xargs git push` — same reason, no literal `git` argv[0].
- Subshells, loops, brace groups: `(cd x && git push)`, `for d in a b; do (cd "$d" && git push); done` — the gate's segment splitter is top-level-operator-aware but doesn't recurse into subshell/loop bodies.
- Unresolvable directories: `cd $DIR`, `cd ~/x`, `git -C "$dir"`, or any `--git-dir`/`--work-tree` override — these poison `dir_known` for the segment (or everything after, for an unresolvable `cd`), which fails open rather than guessing.
- Shlex-unparseable segments: unbalanced quotes cause that segment to be skipped entirely.
- Backslash-escape edge cases in the quote-tracking scanner (best-effort, not a full shell parser).
- Sessions whose `cwd` is outside the workspace entirely — no `canopy.toml` is found walking up, so the gate can't resolve repos/slots and allows everything.

## Debug

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `canopy context [--remote]` | **The registry read (registry consolidation, 4.0 phase 3).** One call for the workspace map: feature ↔ repo ↔ branch ↔ path ↔ slot state ↔ advisories. **Tier 1** (default): local + instant, no network calls. **Tier 2** (`--remote`): adds a live PR + CI + origin-divergence overlay per repo. Intent rule: local code/feature work → `context`; addressing PR comments, checking CI, or review → `context --remote`. Surfaces `unregistered_join_candidate` advisories — repos on the active feature's branch that were never `canopy join`-ed. Powers `preflight`'s context detection and the SessionStart brief. Supersedes the old debug-only `context`; the `workspace_context` MCP tool is deprecated in favor of this. |

## Common patterns

Session start — returning to a feature:

```bash
canopy resume <feature>    # switch-if-needed + fresh brief + bump last-visit anchor
# brief shows: window_hours, since_last_visit counts, current_state, intent_hints
canopy reply <thread_id> --body "Done — fixed in abc123." --resolve  # close a thread
canopy resolve <thread_id>  # close a thread without replying
```

The daily loop:

```bash
canopy triage              # what to work on
canopy state <feature>     # get oriented + see next_actions
canopy switch <feature>    # promote to canonical (handles drift via active rotation)
canopy comments <feature>  # actionable threads only
# ... edit code ...
canopy preflight           # stage + run hooks (dry-run; no commit)
canopy commit -m "..."     # commit across the canonical feature
canopy push                # publish (add --set-upstream on first push)
canopy state <feature>     # confirm transition
```

Switching focus mid-flight (Wave 3.0 slot model):

```bash
# Active rotation: previous focus evacuates into a warm slot, instant to switch back
canopy switch other-feature
# ... work on other-feature ...
canopy switch current-feature   # the warm slot's occupant promotes back to canonical

# Wind-down: previous focus goes cold (feature-tagged stash if dirty)
canopy switch new-feature --release-current

# Inspect slot occupancy + per-slot PR/CI/bots
canopy slots --rich

# Pre-warm a cold feature into a slot without changing canonical
canopy slot load other-feature           # picks lowest free slot
canopy slot load other-feature worktree-2 # pin slot 2

# Free a slot without bringing a new feature in
canopy slot clear worktree-2

# Swap two slots (identical scope required in v1)
canopy slot swap worktree-1 worktree-2
```

Investigate without changing state:

```bash
canopy state <feature> --json | jq .summary
canopy comments <feature> --json | jq '.repos[].actionable_threads'
canopy branch info <feature>
canopy pr <feature>
```
