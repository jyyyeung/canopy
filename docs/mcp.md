# MCP

Canopy is both an MCP **server** (every operation exposed as a tool — agents drive canopy through it) and an MCP **client** (external integrations like Linear and GitHub spawn their MCP servers; canopy never talks to those APIs directly).

## Server

```bash
canopy-mcp   # starts the server over stdio
```

Register in any MCP-compatible client. `canopy init` writes this entry into the workspace's `.mcp.json` automatically:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canopy": {
      "command": "canopy-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": { "CANOPY_ROOT": "/path/to/workspace" }
    }
  }
}
```

`CANOPY_ROOT` scopes the server to one workspace. To use canopy in multiple workspaces simultaneously, register separate entries with different `CANOPY_ROOT` values (or scope MCP per-project via `.mcp.json` at each workspace root).

### Tools (64)

Grouped by topic. Every tool is alias-aware where it accepts a feature input.

#### Meta

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `version` | `{cli_version, mcp_version, schema_version}` for the doctor handshake. The extension calls this once at startup; the doctor uses it to flag CLI/MCP version drift. |
| `doctor` | Diagnose state-file integrity + install staleness; optionally repair. 21 codes across 12 categories — including slot-state checks added in Wave 3.0 (`slot_dir_orphan`, `slot_entry_orphan`, `slot_branch_mismatch`, `slot_detached_head`). **The recovery entry point** — when any other call returns an unexpected error, agents should call `doctor` first to see whether state is corrupted. Returns `{issues, summary, fixed, skipped, ...}`. |

#### Workspace

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace_status` | Full workspace status across all repos. Slot occupancy is reported separately — call `slots` (or `worktree_info`) for the slot-keyed view. |
| `workspace_context` | Detect canopy context from a directory path |
| `workspace_config` | Read or write workspace settings |
| `workspace_reinit` | Rescan repos and regenerate `canopy.toml` |

#### Feature

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `feature_create` | Create a new feature lane across repos |
| `feature_list` | List active feature lanes |
| `feature_status` | Detailed status for a feature lane |
| `feature_diff` | Aggregate diff for a feature lane |
| `feature_changes` | Per-repo file changes for a feature |
| `feature_merge_readiness` | Pre-merge sanity check |
| `feature_paths` | Working directory paths per repo |
| `feature_done` | Clean up worktrees + branches + archive |
| `feature_link_linear` | Attach a Linear issue to a feature |
| `feature_state` | **Dashboard backend.** Returns `{state, summary, next_actions, warnings}`. State ∈ `{drifted, needs_work, in_progress, ready_to_commit, ready_to_push, awaiting_bot_resolution, awaiting_review, approved, no_prs}`. The `summary` carries split `actionable_human_count` + `actionable_bot_count` (M3). See [concepts.md](concepts.md#3-the-9-state-machine). |
| `bot_comments_status` | **M3.** Per-feature rollup of bot review comments — `{feature, repos: {<repo>: {pr_number, total, resolved, unresolved, threads}}, all_resolved, any_bot_comments}`. Resolutions come from the persistent log written by `commit --address`. |
| `historian_decide` | **M4.** Record one or more decisions in the feature's memory file. Accepts `decisions: [{title, rationale}, ...]`. Deduped per-session by title. |
| `historian_pause` | **M4.** Record why the agent stopped — what's blocked, what's needed next. |
| `historian_defer_comment` | **M4.** Mark a review comment as intentionally deferred with a reason. |
| `feature_memory` | **M4.** Read the rendered memory file as markdown — `{feature, memory: <markdown or "">}`. |
| `historian_compact` | **M4.** Trim the Sessions section to the most-recent N (default 5). Resolutions log + PR context are always preserved. |

#### Slots (Wave 3.0)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `slots` | Slot occupancy + (default) per-slot enrichment for the dashboard / agent. With `rich=True` (default), returns the full payload: per-repo branch, dirty + counts, ahead/behind, default branch, last commit, PR + CI rollup, unresolved bot threads, linear link, and the computed `feature_state` for every occupied slot AND canonical. Empty slots are explicit `null`. With `rich=False`, returns the lightweight `slots.json` shape (slot id → feature + last_touched). |
| `slot_load` | Warm a cold feature into a slot **without** changing canonical. `slot_id` defaults to the lowest free slot. `replace=True` evicts the current occupant to cold first. `bootstrap=True` runs env-file copy + install_cmd + IDE workspace gen after load. Raises `worktree_cap_reached` when all slots are full and `replace=False`. The feature must be registered (`feature_create`) first — no silent "treat as all repos" fallback. |
| `slot_clear` | Evict the occupant of a slot to cold (with feature-tagged stash if dirty). The slot id remains; only the occupant moves. |
| `slot_swap` | Exchange the occupants of two slots. v1 requires identical repo scope on both features; mismatched scope raises `BlockerError(code='swap_scope_mismatch')`. |
| `migrate_slots` | One-shot migration from pre-3.0 layout to the 3.0 slot model. Renames `.canopy/worktrees/<feature>/` → `worktree-N/`, rewrites canopy.toml (`max_worktrees` → `slots`), migrates `active_feature.json` → `slots.json`. Idempotency-guarded — refuses if `slots.json` already exists. Returns `{moved, slots, canonical, slot_count}`. |

#### Action (Wave 2)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `triage` | Prioritized list of features needing attention. Cross-repo PR fetch, grouped by feature, sorted by review state. |
| `switch` | **The focus primitive (Wave 3.0 slot model).** Promote a feature to the canonical slot. Active rotation (default) evacuates the previously-canonical feature into a warm slot; `release_current=True` (wind-down) sends it to cold with a feature-tagged stash. When the destination is already warm, the swap is a fast 5-op-per-repo dance — no `mv`, no slot renaming. Slot-targeted args: `evict_to=<slot-N>` pins where the outgoing canonical lands; `to_slot=<slot-N>` promotes whatever feature occupies that slot (omit `feature`). Cap-reached blocker surfaces explicit fix actions. See [docs/concepts.md §4](concepts.md#4-the-slot-model). |
| `drift` | Cached alignment view from `.canopy/state/heads.json`. Fast, hook-driven. |

#### Read primitives (alias-aware)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `issue_get` | Fetch an issue from the workspace's configured provider (Linear or GitHub Issues). Accepts a provider-native ID (`SIN-412`, `#142`) or feature alias. M5+. |
| `issue_list_my_issues` | List the current user's open issues from the configured provider. M5+. |
| `linear_get_issue` | **Deprecated alias for `issue_get`** — kept for backward compat; will be removed in a future release. |
| `linear_my_issues` | **Deprecated alias for `issue_list_my_issues`.** |
| `github_get_pr` | PR data per repo. Accepts feature alias, `<repo>#<n>`, or PR URL. |
| `github_get_branch` | Branch HEAD/divergence/upstream per repo. Accepts feature or `<repo>:<branch>`. |
| `github_get_pr_comments` | Temporally classified review comments. Same alias forms as `github_get_pr`. |

#### Run / preflight

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `run` | Run a shell command in a canopy-managed repo. Pass `repo` (and optional `feature`); canopy resolves the cwd. |
| `preflight` | Run pre-commit hooks per repo. Records result to `.canopy/state/preflight.json` for `feature_state`. |
| `review_status` / `review_comments` / `review_prep` | Older review composites. Prefer `feature_state` + `github_get_pr_comments`. |

#### Stash (feature-aware)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `stash_save_feature` | Stash with feature tag (incl. untracked). |
| `stash_list_grouped` | List grouped by feature tag. |
| `stash_pop_feature` | Pop most recent matching tagged stash per repo. |
| `stash_save` / `stash_pop` / `stash_list` / `stash_drop` | Plain (non-feature-tagged) stash ops. |

#### Worktree / branch / log

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `worktree_create` | Create a feature with worktrees in numbered slots (`.canopy/worktrees/worktree-N/<repo>/`). Allocates the lowest free slot; returns `slot_id` alongside `worktree_paths` so callers can reference the slot directly. Optionally linked to a Linear issue. |
| `worktree_info` | Live worktree state — slot-keyed map (`{worktree-N: {feature, repos: {<repo>: {branch, dirty, dirty_count, dirty_files, ahead, behind, default_branch, path}}}}`) plus the per-repo `git worktree list` from the main working tree. |
| `branch_list` / `branch_delete` / `branch_rename` | Branch ops across repos |
| `log` | Interleaved commit log across repos |
| `checkout` | Checkout a branch across repos |
| `sync` | Pull default + rebase feature branches |

## Client

Canopy spawns external MCP servers on demand. Two transports.

### stdio (subprocess)

For local servers (npm, python, etc.):

```json
// .canopy/mcps.json or .mcp.json
{
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "ghp_..." }
  }
}
```

The client module (`canopy.mcp.client`) wraps the MCP SDK's `stdio_client` + `ClientSession`. Sync wrapper handles event loop management for CLI use.

### HTTP + OAuth (browser flow)

For hosted servers like Linear's official MCP — no API key needed:

```json
{
  "linear": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp",
    "oauth": true
  }
}
```

First call opens the browser to the OAuth authorize URL; canopy spins up a one-shot HTTP server on `localhost:33418` to capture the redirect. Tokens cache at `~/.canopy/mcp-tokens/<server>.{client,tokens}.json`. Subsequent calls reuse the cached token silently. Tokens auto-refresh as long as the refresh token is valid.

> **Heads up — OAuth needs a TTY.** The first-call browser flow requires a TTY-attached process (Claude Code, your shell, the canopy CLI). If you invoke an MCP method *headlessly* — e.g. `python -c "from canopy.mcp.server import issue_list_my_issues; issue_list_my_issues()"` from a script — and the cached token is missing or expired, the OAuth handshake will hang waiting for a redirect that can never arrive (test-findings F-4). For tests, exercise providers directly via their classes with `call_tool` mocked at the module boundary, or rely on a pre-authorised session.

For HTTP servers that use header auth instead of OAuth:

```json
{
  "some-server": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ..." }
  }
}
```

### gh CLI fallback for GitHub

If no `github` MCP server is configured, canopy falls back to the user's local `gh` CLI for GitHub operations. Same return shapes either way; calling code doesn't branch.

If neither is available:

```
github_not_configured
  Install + auth gh CLI:  brew install gh && gh auth login   (macOS)
                          (platform-aware install hint per OS)
  Or configure github MCP in .canopy/mcps.json
```

## Skill (using-canopy)

The MCP server makes tools available; the [`using-canopy`](../src/canopy/agent_setup/skill.md) skill teaches the agent *when* to prefer them. Without the skill, agents default to raw `Bash + git + gh` (training data).

Installed by `canopy init` (or standalone via `canopy setup-agent`) at `~/.claude/skills/using-canopy/SKILL.md`. Loads in any new Claude Code session targeting a workspace where canopy MCP is registered.

See [agents.md](agents.md) for the full integration story.

## Architectural rules

- Canopy never imports external APIs directly. Linear, GitHub, etc. all flow through MCP (or `gh` CLI fallback for GitHub).
- The MCP server (`canopy.mcp.server`) is a thin wrapper. Business logic lives in `canopy.actions.*`, `canopy.features.*`, `canopy.git.*`. Adding a tool = registering an existing function under `@mcp.tool()`.
- Token storage is opt-in per server (`oauth: true` enables `~/.canopy/mcp-tokens/`); stdio servers carry credentials in `env`.
