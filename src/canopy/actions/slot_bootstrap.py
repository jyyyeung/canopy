"""Auto-bootstrap on slot creation — the PROVISIONAL timing seam.

Fast steps (env, ide, hooks) run synchronously so the worktree is
immediately usable for edit/commit/push. Deps install runs in the
background with status recorded in slots.json; failure is a loud state,
not a silent hole. Swap the strategy here without touching switch.
