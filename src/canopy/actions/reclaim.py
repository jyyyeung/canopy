"""Reclaim-as-vacate: free a warm slot when its PR is merged.

Slots are generic reusable dirs. Reclaim = checkout base + drop the
slots.json entry (slot returns to the free pool; dir + warm deps persist).
Clean worktree only; a dirty merged slot is surfaced as an advisory and
left untouched. Detection is passive (reads prs_cache — no network here).
