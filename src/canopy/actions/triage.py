"""triage(author) — the agent's daily entry point.

Enumerates open PRs across all configured repos, groups by feature lane
(explicit from features.json or implicit by shared branch name), runs
each group's review comments through the temporal classifier, and tags
each feature with a priority tier:

    changes_requested  > review_required_with_bot_comments
                       > review_required
                       > approved

Designed for the user's morning workflow: ``canopy triage`` returns a
single ordered list of "what needs my attention right now".
