"""switch — the canonical-slot focus primitive.

`switch(Y)` promotes Y to the canonical slot (main checkout). Whatever was
canonical before either:

  - **Active rotation (default)**: evacuates to a warm worktree at
    ``.canopy/worktrees/<previous>/<repo>/`` so it stays close at hand.
  - **Wind-down (``release_current=True``)**: goes cold (just the branch +
    a feature-tagged stash if there were dirty changes). Use when the
    previous focus is parked / finished and Y is the new focus.

Per-repo recipe per mode is in ``evacuate.py`` (active-rotation) and
inline below (wind-down). Cap-reached failures surface via
``switch_preflight.py`` as a structured ``BlockerError`` with explicit
fix actions — no silent eviction.

PR1 scope: the canonical-slot behavior end-to-end with preflight as the
primary safety net. PR2 adds journal + rollback walker for the residual
mid-op failures. PR3 adds the fast-path 3-checkout swap when both X and
Y already have homes.
