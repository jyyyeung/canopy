"""Rich per-slot enrichment for the slots MCP shape (T15).

Composes ``feature_state`` + ``bot_status`` + ``FeatureCoordinator.status``
per slot occupant + canonical. Single function so the CLI / MCP / dashboard
layers stay thin — and so the agent and the human read the same payload.

The shape mirrors the dashboard's grid: one slot block per occupied slot
(``None`` when empty, never ``{}``), and per-repo facts inside each block
limited to the repos the feature actually touches (partial-scope features
stay partial here).
