"""``canopy draft_replies`` — auto-draft "Done in <sha>" replies (M9).

For each unresolved PR review comment in the feature's repos, walk the
file's commit history since the comment was anchored. If anything
changed, the comment is "addressed" — render a template-based draft
reply the user can review and post.

This is template-based on purpose. The user reviews the draft before
posting; an LLM-generated reply isn't worth the cost/latency for text
they'll edit anyway. Future ``draft_replies --llm`` is reserved.

Read-only — generates text, never posts. Posting is a separate (future)
``post_replies`` action.
