"""feature_state(feature) — single source of truth for the dashboard CTAs.

Composes drift detection (P1) + dirty/branch state (workspace) + ahead/behind
(git) + temporal-filtered review comments (P4) + recorded preflight result
(``preflight_state``) + GitHub PR data (gh CLI fallback or MCP) into one
of these states:

    drifted          -- branches not on the feature; first thing to fix
    needs_work       -- review feedback exists (CHANGES_REQUESTED or
                        actionable threads from any reviewer)
    in_progress      -- aligned, dirty tree, no fresh preflight
    ready_to_commit  -- aligned, dirty tree, preflight passed for current HEAD
    ready_to_push    -- aligned, clean, ahead of remote
    awaiting_review  -- aligned, clean, pushed, PRs open, no actionable threads
    approved         -- all PRs approved
    no_prs           -- aligned, clean, no PRs anywhere

The state result also carries a ``next_actions`` list — the dashboard
renders the first one as the primary CTA, the rest as secondary. Same
data the agent uses to decide what to do next, so the human and the
agent stay in lockstep.
