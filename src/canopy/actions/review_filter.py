"""Temporal classification of PR review threads.

Compares each review comment's ``created_at`` to the branch's latest
commit timestamp and to commits that touched the comment's file. Splits
threads into actionable / likely_resolved / resolved so the agent's
context budget goes to comprehension, not to figuring out which feedback
is current.

Uses timestamp + path matching only — no NLP. Bot threads are NOT
filtered by author here: a ``claude[bot]`` thread may carry the only
actionable feedback, and the temporal heuristic handles staleness
regardless.

    """Bucket review comments into actionable / likely_resolved.

    Algorithm (per the research doc):
        if comment.created_at > branch.latest_commit_at:
            ACTIONABLE  — posted after latest commit, not addressed yet
        elif any commit on branch after the comment touched the comment's path:
            LIKELY_RESOLVED  — file was modified after the comment
        else:
            ACTIONABLE  — old comment, file untouched since

    Args:
        comments: normalized comments from ``integrations.github.get_review_comments``.
            Each dict must have ``path``, ``created_at`` (ISO 8601), plus
            anything else the consumer wants. Comments with ``state == 'RESOLVED'``
            are excluded upstream by ``_normalize_comments``.
        repo_path: local repo path for git history lookups.
        branch: branch name to use as the comparison ref.

    Returns:
        ``{actionable_threads, likely_resolved_threads, resolved_thread_count,
           latest_commit_at}``.

        ``actionable_threads`` carry the full comment dict, plus
        ``classification_reason`` describing why they're flagged.
        ``likely_resolved_threads`` carry a slim summary: ``path``, ``author``,
        ``created_at``, plus ``addressed_by_commit`` (sha) and ``reason``.
