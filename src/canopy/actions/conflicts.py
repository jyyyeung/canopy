"""``canopy conflicts`` — cross-feature file-overlap detection.

Pairwise intersects each active feature's changed-file set per repo. Flags
pairs that touch the same file (and, when we can read it cheaply, the
same line ranges) so the user can rebase proactively instead of discovering
the conflict at PR-merge time.

V1 ships file-level severity by default — same file in both features ==
``high`` because the rebase will produce a textual conflict marker even if
the diffs would have auto-merged. The ``--lines`` flag opts into the more
expensive line-range comparison and downgrades to ``medium`` when the
files overlap but the actual line ranges don't intersect.

Read-only — no canopy state files are touched.
