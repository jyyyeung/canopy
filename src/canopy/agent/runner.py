"""Directory-safe shell exec for agents.

Eliminates the agent's ``cd <wrong-dir> && command`` mistake class by
making the agent pass ``(repo, command, feature?)`` semantically.
canopy resolves the working directory itself.

Trust boundary: the command string is shell-executed without
sanitization. The agent IS the trust boundary. The point of this tool
is path correctness, not command sandboxing.
